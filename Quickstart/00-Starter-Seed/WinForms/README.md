Samples for using the Auth0 OidcClient with Windows Forms / WPF applications

This repo is supported and maintained by Community Developers, not Auth0. For more information about different support levels check https://auth0.com/docs/support/matrix .

## Getting started

Make sure that `App.config` contains your application domain and clientID. Also, don't forget register `https://tutorials.auth0.com/mobile` as Allowed Callback URLs.

Hit F5 to start application.

## Usage

**1. Install NuGet**

~~~ps
Install-Package Auth0.OidcClient.WinForms
~~~

**2. Instantiate Auth0Client**

~~~cs
using Auth0.OidcClient;

var client = new Auth0Client(new Auth0ClientOptions
{
Domain = "{YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN}",
ClientId = "{YOUR_CLIENT_ID}"
});
~~~

**3. Trigger login (with Widget)**

~~~cs
var loginResult = await client.LoginAsync();

if (!loginResult.IsError)
{
Debug.WriteLine($"id_token: {loginResult.IdentityToken}");
Debug.WriteLine($"access_token: {loginResult.AccessToken}");
Debug.WriteLine($"name: {loginResult.User.FindFirst(c => c.Type == "name")?.Value}");
Debug.WriteLine($"email: {loginResult.User.FindFirst(c => c.Type == "email")?.Value}");
}

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like
* Google
* Facebook
* Microsoft
* Linkedin
* GitHub
* Twitter
* Box
* Salesforce
* etc.

**or** enterprise identity systems like:
* Windows Azure AD
* Google Apps
* Active Directory
* ADFS

* Add authentication through more traditional [username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)
* Add support for [linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts) with the same user
* Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and create user identity flow securely
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in
* Pull data from other sources and add it to user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules)
